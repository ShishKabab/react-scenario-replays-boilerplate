# Scenario replays with React + Typescript boilerplate

Still under construction, but when finished, it will demonstrate:

1. how to jump to specific points in automated tests
2. how to create an overview UI where you can browse through all workflows in your program (free always-up-to-date design docs)

For now, more in at https://www.vdenboer.com/blog/scenario-replays . When the boilerplate is finished, extensive docs will follow :)
